## Using HDFS with Elly

The sections below show a some simple examples and cover most of the APIs available. A complete API documentation is not available yet.

### Connecting to HDFS
A connection is represented as `HDFSClient`. It is essentially a connection to the namenode, and all Elly APIs require this to be provided directly or indirectly.

````
julia> using Elly

julia> dfs = HDFSClient("localhost", 9000)
HDFSClient: hdfs://hdfs@localhost:9000/
    id: 3c9f6059-7e35-44
    connected: false
    pwd: /
````

In the example above, `dfs` is the instance of `HDFSClient` which needs to be used with other APIs. It will be connected automatically on first use. The dfs working directory is set to `/` on a new client.

### Navigating the DFS
The DFS can be navigated using the same Julia APIs as used for a traditional file system, except that the DFS equivalents need the `HDFSClient` connection to be passed to them.

````
...
julia> pwd(dfs)
"/"

julia> du(dfs)
0x0000000000000017

julia> readdir(dfs)
5-element Array{AbstractString,1}:
 "testdir" 
 "tmp"     
 "user"    
 "x"       
 
julia> cd(dfs, "tmp")
"/tmp"

julia> mkdir(dfs, "foo")
true

julia> cd(dfs, "foo")
"/tmp/foo"
...
````

### Files on DFS
A file on the DFS is identified by a combination of an `HDFSClient` instance (to identify the DFS) and a path. A relative path will be resolved using the directory context as present in the associated `HDFSClient` instance. An `HDFSFile` instance can be created either by passing an `HDFSClient` and `path` or by providing a HDFS URL.

All familiar Julia APIs work on a `HDFSFile`.

````
...
julia> bar_file = HDFSFile(dfs, "bar")
HDFSFile: hdfs://userid@localhost:9000/tmp/foo/bar

julia> touch(bar_file)

julia> stat(bar_file)
HDFSFileInfo: bar
    type: file
    size: 0
    block_sz: 134217728
    owner: userid
    group: supergroup

julia> isfile(bar_file)
true

julia> isdir(bar_file)
false

julia> islink(bar_file)
false

julia> filemode(bar_file)
0x000001a4

julia> mtime(bar_file)
0x0000016f7f71aa30

julia> atime(bar_file)
0x0000016f7f71a980

julia> dirname(bar_file)
HDFSFile: hdfs://userid@localhost:9000/tmp/foo/

julia> joinpath(dirname(bar_file), "baz_file")
HDFSFile: hdfs://userid@localhost:9000/tmp/foo/baz_file

...
````

### File IO
At present Elly supports only reading and writing files (appends are not yet supported). Most Julia file IO methods work with HDFS files. There are a few differences to keep in mind though. When a file is opened for write, a lease for the file is obtained from the namenode. The lease must be updated periodically. If the file is actively being written to, or if the application often `yields` control to other tasks, the lease will be renewed automatically. Otherwise, the `renewlease` API must be called periodically (depends on the DFS configuration, but usually once in 10 minutes).

````
...

julia> baz_file = HDFSFile(dfs, "baz.txt")
HDFSFile: hdfs://userid@localhost:9000/tmp/foo/baz.txt

julia> cp("baz.txt", baz_file)

julia> stat(baz_file)
HDFSFileInfo: baz.txt
    type: file
    size: 76
    block_sz: 134217728
    owner: userid
    group: supergroup

julia> open(bar_file, "w") do f
           write(f, b"hello world")
       end
11

julia> open(bar_file, "r") do f
           bytes = Vector{UInt8}(undef, filesize(f))
           read!(f, bytes)
           println(String(bytes))
       end
hello world
````

Elly also supports block level access to files, to enable distributed processing.

```
julia> hdfs_blocks(huge_file)
1-element Array{Tuple{UInt64,Array},1}:
 (0x0000000000000000, AbstractString["node1"])
 (0x0000000007d00000, AbstractString["node2"])
 (0x000000000fa00000, AbstractString["node3"])

```
